# Registry

## Backend Requirements

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

## Local docker image registry

* Start the stack with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Registry API: http://localhost

Traefik UI, to see how the routes are being handled by the proxy: http://localhost:8090

**Note**: The first time you start your stack, it might take a minute for it to be ready. While the backend waits for the database to be ready and configures everything. You can check the logs to monitor it.

To check the logs, run:

```bash
docker-compose logs
```

If your Docker is not running in `localhost` (the URLs above wouldn't work) check the sections below on **Development with Docker Toolbox** and **Development with a custom IP**.

## Deployment

You can deploy the stack to a Docker Swarm mode cluster with a main Traefik proxy, set up using the ideas from <a href="https://dockerswarm.rocks" target="_blank">DockerSwarm.rocks</a>, to get automatic HTTPS certificates, etc.

And you can use CI (continuous integration) systems to do it automatically.

But you have to configure a couple things first.

### Traefik network

This stack expects the public Traefik network to be named `traefik-public`, just as in the tutorials in <a href="https://dockerswarm.rocks" class="external-link" target="_blank">DockerSwarm.rocks</a>.

If you need to use a different Traefik public network name, update it in the `docker-compose.yml` files, in the section:

```YAML
networks:
  traefik-public:
    external: true
```

Change `traefik-public` to the name of the used Traefik network. And then update it in the file `.env`:

```bash
TRAEFIK_PUBLIC_NETWORK=traefik-public
```

### Persisting Docker named volumes

You need to make sure that each service (Docker container) that uses a volume is always deployed to the same Docker "node" in the cluster, that way it will preserve the data. Otherwise, it could be deployed to a different node each time, and each time the volume would be created in that new node before starting the service. As a result, it would look like your service was starting from scratch every time, losing all the previous data.

That's specially important for a service running a database. But the same problem would apply if you were saving files in your main backend service (for example, if those files were uploaded by your users, or if they were created by your system).

To solve that, you can put constraints in the services that use one or more data volumes (like databases) to make them be deployed to a Docker node with a specific label. And of course, you need to have that label assigned to one (only one) of your nodes.

#### Adding services with volumes

For each service that uses a volume (databases, services with uploaded files, etc) you should have a label constraint in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

To make sure that your labels are unique per volume per stack (for example, that they are not the same for `prod` and `stag`) you should prefix them with the name of your stack and then use the same name of the volume.

Then you need to have those constraints in your `docker-compose.yml` file for the services that need to be fixed with each volume.

```bash
STACK_NAME=registry-com sh ./scripts/deploy.sh
```

To use and expand that environment variable inside the `docker-compose.yml` files you can add the constraints to the services like:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  db:
    volumes:
      - 'app-db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata'
    deploy:
      placement:
        constraints:
          - node.labels.${STACK_NAME?Variable not set}.app-db-data == true
```

note the `${STACK_NAME?Variable not set}`. In the script `./scripts/deploy.sh`, the `docker-compose.yml` would be converted, and saved to a file `docker-stack.yml` containing:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  db:
    volumes:
      - 'app-db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata'
    deploy:
      placement:
        constraints:
          - node.labels.registry-com.app-db-data == true
```

**Note**: The `${STACK_NAME?Variable not set}` means "use the environment variable `STACK_NAME`, but if it is not set, show an error `Variable not set`".

If you add more volumes to your stack, you need to make sure you add the corresponding constraints to the services that use that named volume.

Then you have to create those labels in some nodes in your Docker Swarm mode cluster. You can use `docker-auto-labels` to do it automatically.

#### `docker-auto-labels`

You can use [`docker-auto-labels`](https://github.com/tiangolo/docker-auto-labels) to automatically read the placement constraint labels in your Docker stack (Docker Compose file) and assign them to a random Docker node in your Swarm mode cluster if those labels don't exist yet.

To do that, you can install `docker-auto-labels`:

```bash
pip install docker-auto-labels
```

And then run it passing your `docker-stack.yml` file as a parameter:

```bash
docker-auto-labels docker-stack.yml
```

You can run that command every time you deploy, right before deploying, as it doesn't modify anything if the required labels already exist.

#### (Optionally) adding labels manually

If you don't want to use `docker-auto-labels` or for any reason you want to manually assign the constraint labels to specific nodes in your Docker Swarm mode cluster, you can do the following:

* First, connect via SSH to your Docker Swarm mode cluster.

* Then check the available nodes with:

```console
$ docker node ls


// you would see an output like:

ID                            HOSTNAME               STATUS              AVAILABILITY        MANAGER STATUS
nfa3d4df2df34as2fd34230rm *   dog.example.com        Ready               Active              Reachable
2c2sd2342asdfasd42342304e     cat.example.com        Ready               Active              Leader
c4sdf2342asdfasd4234234ii     snake.example.com      Ready               Active              Reachable
```

then chose a node from the list. For example, `dog.example.com`.

* Add the label to that node. Use as label the name of the stack you are deploying followed by a dot (`.`) followed by the named volume, and as value, just `true`, e.g.:

```bash
docker node update --label-add registry-com.app-db-data=true dog.example.com
```

* Then you need to do the same for each stack version you have. For example, for staging you could do:

```bash
docker node update --label-add registry-com.app-db-data=true cat.example.com
```

### Deploy to a Docker Swarm mode cluster

There are 3 steps:

2. **Build** your app images
3. **Deploy** your stack

---

Here are the steps in detail:
1. **Provide an admin username with password**
* Create an environment variable with a username (you will use it for the HTTP Basic Auth for Registry), for example:

```bash
export USERNAME=admin
```

* Create an environment variable with the password, e.g.:

```bash
export PASSWORD=changethis
```

* Use `openssl` to generate the "hashed" version of the password and store it in an environment variable:

```bash
export HASHED_PASSWORD=$(openssl passwd -apr1 $PASSWORD)
```

2. **Build your app images**

* Set these environment variables, right before the next command:
  * `DOMAIN=registry.tmd.fakhred.in`
  * `TRAEFIK_TAG=registry.com`
  * `STACK_NAME=registry-com`
* Use the provided `build.sh` file with those environment variables:

```bash
DOMAIN=registry.tmd.fakhred.in \
TRAEFIK_TAG=registry.com \
STACK_NAME=registry-com \
bash ./build.sh
```

3. **Deploy your stack**

* Set these environment variables:
  * `STACK_NAME=registry-com`
* Use the provided `deploy.sh` file with those environment variables:

```bash
STACK_NAME=registry-com \
bash ./deploy.sh
```

## Docker Compose files and env vars

There is a main `docker-compose.yml` file with all the configurations that apply to the whole stack, it is used automatically by `docker-compose`.

And there's also a `docker-compose.override.yml` with overrides for development, for example to mount the source code as a volume. It is used automatically by `docker-compose` to apply overrides on top of `docker-compose.yml`.

These Docker Compose files use the `.env` file containing configurations to be injected as environment variables in the containers.

They also use some additional configurations taken from environment variables set in the scripts before calling the `docker-compose` command.

It is all designed to support several "stages", like development, building, testing, and deployment. Also, allowing the deployment to different environments like staging and production (and you can add more environments very easily).

They are designed to have the minimum repetition of code and configurations, so that if you need to change something, you have to change it in the minimum amount of places. That's why files use environment variables that get auto-expanded. That way, if for example, you want to use a different domain, you can call the `docker-compose` command with a different `DOMAIN` environment variable instead of having to change the domain in several places inside the Docker Compose files.

Also, if you want to have another deployment environment, say `preprod`, you just have to change environment variables, but you can keep using the same Docker Compose files.

### The .env file

The `.env` file is the one that contains all your configurations, generated keys and passwords, etc.

Depending on your workflow, you could want to exclude it from Git, for example if your project is public. In that case, you would have to make sure to set up a way for your CI tools to obtain it while building or deploying your project.

One way to do it could be to add each environment variable to your CI/CD system, and updating the `docker-compose.yml` file to read that specific env var instead of reading the `.env` file.

## URLs

These are the URLs that will be used and generated by the project.

### Local URLs

Development URLs, for local development.

Registry API: http://localhost

Traefik UI: http://localhost:8090
